## Summary
Hello everyone, today, January 24, 2025, I was officially accepted for the backend intern position at Viettel Cyber Security. I’m writing this blog to share my journey and experiences as a second-year student that helped me pass this position.

Alright, the article will be quite long, so I'll divide it into 3 parts:
- Part 1: CV Screening and the entrance exam (which include English Test, IQ Test, and Technical Test).
- Part 2: The assessment round (Competitive Programming).
- Part 3: The final round (Interview).

By the way, the program I applied for is the Viettel Passport, which takes place around November every year. Below are some of the criteria set by the company:

And here are some fields that the company provides training in. For my part, I chose the backend specialization:

Alright, no more delays, let's get started!

## CV Screening
I had never applied for a job before, so I had no idea how to write a CV for myself. I searched on Google for "resume template" and found the Overleaf website, which offers ready-made CV templates in LaTeX. All I had to do was fill in my information. However, the part that gave me the most headache was the "personal projects" section. I didn't have any, except for two group projects I worked on with my teammates at university. So, I just wrote them down anyway.

And boom! After two hours of tinkering, I managed to create my personal CV, with a little help from ChatGPT =)). You can check out my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gf7Z1tgvb785Qs62W974qSxqpMqOYNZ7/view?usp=sharing).

About two weeks later, I received a notification that I had passed the CV Screening round (quite a surprise). I was then guided to join a group to take the entrance exams, including English, IQ, and the technical test.

## English Test
To be honest, I'm pretty bad at English. Even this blog you're reading right now is written with the help of ChatGPT =))). So, I didn't dare to take the TOEIC test.

However, my English grades at university were quite good.Specifically, I got an A (8.9) in the B1 English course and an A (8.6) in the B2 English course. Because of this, I messaged HR to request an exemption from the English test by submitting my transcript, and HR agreed =)))). I managed to skip the English test pretty easily, hahaha!
## IQ Test
The IQ test, however, couldn’t be skipped. But I was fairly confident that I’d pass.

If I remember correctly, the passing condition was to score at least 90/120. There was something pretty funny about this test, though. The questions were randomly selected from a question bank without any difficulty level classification. So, if you’re unlucky, you might get hit with a series of "bruhhhh" questions. The questions mostly revolved around topics like numerical logic, geometry, patterns, and so on.

Luckily, I didn’t choke during the test and managed to score 102/120, if I recall correctly.
## Technical Test
And finally, there was the technical test on information technology. To summarize, the test covered topics like data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, computer networks, operating systems, databases, and so on. But everything was at a pretty basic level, nothing too deep.

The unfortunate part was that when I applied, I hadn’t yet studied subjects like computer networks, operating systems, or databases =))). Fortunately, about 65% of the questions in my exam were related to data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. For the remaining questions, I just guessed =))).

In the end, I got 39/50, which I guess was good enough.
## Conclusion
After completing the three tests, I was notified that I had passed and would be participating in a competitive programming contest at Viettel's headquarters :D. And that’s all about the first three tests and the CV screening round. In my next post, I’ll go over the competitive programming problems and share some fun memories from the test day. See you then!
