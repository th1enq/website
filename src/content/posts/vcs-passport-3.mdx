## Summary

Hello, I'm back! Due to some work, I only had time to write the third post today. At the same time, the Viettel Digital Talent program is taking place, so I quickly completed this article to provide some small help to a few of my friends who are preparing for their interviews.

By the way, my main interview position is for a backend role. However, I also received an offer to interview for a core dev C/C++ position. So, I'll be sharing both interview experiences here.

Alright, let's get started!

## Preparation

As I mentioned earlier, the self-introduction part is crucial in making a strong impression. Since I had prepared in advance, my response was very smooth. After listening, the interviewer even said, "Oh, impressive!" xD...

At the same time, researching the position you're applying for and the company itself—specifically in this case, Viettel Cyber Security—is extremely important. Recruiters want to see whether you've taken the time to learn about the company. This helps them gain a better impression of you.

## Technical Interview
After that, the interviewer asked me some questions about Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and basic networking. Here are some of the questions I encountered:

### Data structures & Algorithms
- Calculate the `nth` Fibonacci number using recursion and iteration.
- If `n` is too large, using iteration is no longer feasible. In that case, what should be done?
- How many ways are there to pass parameters to an array?
- Explain how to delete a node and add a new node in a linked list.
- What is a balanced binary tree? What is its maximum height? How is it different from a heap?
### Programming Language
- In C/C++, passing an array to a function is done by reference (using a pointer).
- Differentiate between pass-by-value and pass-by-pointer.
- C/C++ is commonly used for projects such as ?
- Why is C/C++ so fast?
- What special features does Java have compared to other languages?
### Object-Oriented Programming
- How many principles of OOP are there?
- Explain polymorphism. Differentiate between overriding and overloading.
### Networking
- What happens when I type "google.com" in the search bar and press Enter?
- ...
### Project
- How do the authentication and authorization mechanisms work in your project? Please explain.
- How can you connect to the database and retrieve data in your library project?
- What methods can be used to optimize SQL queries in that project?
- In your game project, what method do you use to create the map? Please explain in detail.
- How can collisions and interactions between objects in a game be detected?
- Is Dijkstra's algorithm used in the game? Please explain in detail.

### Blockchain
- Talk about the three properties that define blockchain.
- Describe how a blockchain works.

### Off-topic
- How is learning and competing in algorithms on a national team different from studying it at university?
- How is the distance from Earth to the Moon measured? (btw I don't understand why they asked me this question in an IT interview???)

## Result
- The final interview round had 12 candidates, and in the end, 7 were selected.

## Conclusion
- The above are only about 2/3 of the questions I can remember. But most of the questions seem quite basic
- The purpose of this interview is simply to assess, "Do you have the potential to be trained into a competent employee?" rather than to compete with you.
- That's why my advice to you is to stay confident, calm, and cheerful. Success will surely come to everyone. Good luck to you all. See yaaa!
- Sorry my bad English :DDD
